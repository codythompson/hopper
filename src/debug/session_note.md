## TODO

1. Make an Entityer, that grabs entities for a given chunk coord
2. add p2js or physicsjs to entity's (and blocks?)
3. better chunk filler
4. I changed the order of transformations for the camera's MV mat. This mightve accidentally worked and have onforeseen consequences.

## longterm ideas
- asynch chunk filling via webworkers
