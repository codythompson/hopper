## TODO

1. add p2js or physicsjs to entity's (and blocks?)
2. better chunk filler
3. I changed the order of transformations for the camera's MV mat. This mightve accidentally worked and have onforeseen consequences.
4. add fps to dev box

## longterm ideas
- asynch chunk filling via webworkers
